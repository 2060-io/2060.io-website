2060 is a decentralized and open network that provides all the decentralized services needed by any Web3 application: identity, storage, signalling and communication channels, like cloud services provided by existing large players.

2060 aims to dramatically encourage adoption of Web3, Self-Sovereign Identity and Verifiable Credentials.

## Open standards
2060 is more than just a space to exchange credentials, itâ€™s a gateway to an open self-sovereign internet based on open standards.

W3C Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials Data Model, DIF DIDComm Messaging, Presentation exchange, Confidential Data and Decentralized Web Node, Hyperledger Aries are, to name a few, the standards 2060 is relying on.

## Your privacy at stake
2060 Wallet is used to store all private data from any entity that will use the network (person, organization department). It allows establishing private persistent connections with other entities.

It is possible to assign a contactability profile for each connection, in order to select what kind of communication (chat, call, video call) is permitted.

Wallet is available as a SDK for easy integration into Web3 Apps. Some Apps are already being built, such as an experimental 2060 client for the end user.

## Very Verified Verifiers
Register your organization as an Issuer in the Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), and start delivering Verifiable Credentials to your connections. 

Verify any credential presentation from your connections. Authenticate a user by verifying his credential delivered by a registered Identity Verification Service, and take action based on the User's identity: mobile app access token, authenticated chat, call, new verifiable credential issuance...

2060 governance rules ensure transparency and reliability from public and verifiable organizations.

## You are the network
2060 is composed of publicly decentralized services, and a decentralized system backend, which obeys a 2060 governance framework. 

Anyone can run 2060 publicly decentralized service nodes, and get rewarded $TS, the 2060 token.
