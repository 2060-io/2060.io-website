## For Organizations
Our third-party SDKs provide your Apps with a broad spectrum of customer-centric features, powered by a set of versatile APIs.

Identity and Verifiable Credentials
Embed the 2060 Wallet SDK in your services, register as an Issuer in the Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), and start to issue and verify credentials.
