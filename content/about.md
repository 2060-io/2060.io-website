Our vision is to provide a network based on open standards that will democratize usage of verifiable credentials and SSI, so that we can give privacy and data control back to the end user, and enable trust between entities.

This network will provide all the decentralized services needed by any web5 application: identity, storage, signaling and communication channels, like existing cloud services provided by existing large players. 

We believe web5 needs no intermediary, thatâ€™s why in our model, anyone can become a producer, run the network and its services and get rewarded for this, and anyone can be a consumer, use the network and its services by paying the corresponding fee to producers.
