Our Mission

Provide "privacy by design" online ecosystem by using implementing Self Sovereign Identity and Verifiable Credentials concepts so that the Internet will become more trustable and Users will finally control their own data.

Our Vision

Nowadays, digital business models are generally based on user data (Digital Assets, or DAs) control and monetization. Any service is a pretext to collect data and monetize it. Giving all the power to few giant companies is problematic and leads to huge issues in case of a security breach. Furthermore, data is so valuable that even if law prohibits salvage data sharing / processing, experience already showed us that it is not possible to control it. In other words, User cannot control his/her data. In a society each time more “digital”, this is not acceptable as it leads to power centralization and abuse. At the same time, data can be controlled, misused and abused by Governments.

2060 will break the paradigm and provide a full ecosystem that will allow third party companies deploying secure and privacy by design B2C and B2B services, while offering Users a total control of their identity, credentials, and Digital Assets (DAs).
